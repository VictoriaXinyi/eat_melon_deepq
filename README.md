# Eat Melon ! A Deep Q Reinforcement Learning Demo

This [demo](http://projects.rajivshah.com/rldemo/) is a fun way to gain familiarity with the Deep Q Learning algorithm. It is based off Karpathy's [ConvNetJS Deep Q Learning Demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html) with some tweaks on the UI side. You can fiddle with reward and model parameters, see how that affects the agent, which should give you a feel for how Deep Q learning works. 

See the demo for more details or watch the [demo video](https://youtu.be/3TUZw1rlvXc).  There is another video forthcoming that will walkthrough the code and the changes I made.
